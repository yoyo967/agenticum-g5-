# Technical Whitepaper: AGENTICUM G5 System Architecture

## 1. Introduction: The Agentic Infrastructure Paradigm
The AGENTICUM G5 system is not merely a SaaS tool; it is an industrial-grade operating system defining a new architectural norm. It marks the strategic transition from reactive "Generative AI" to proactive "Agentic AI," effectively eliminating "Generative Latency."

## 2. The 52-Node Mesh Architecture
A decentralized mesh architecture based on modularity, functional specialization, and infinite scalability.
- **Orchestration Core (SN-00)**: Goal decomposition and objective routing.
- **Multimodal Forge (CC-Cluster)**: Industrial production (Veo 3.1, Imagen 4).
- **Forensic Research (RA-Cluster)**: Grounding via the GATES Protocol.
- **Adversarial Defense (RA-52/55)**: IP protection and deep-fake mitigation.
- **Strategic Capital (SP-Cluster)**: Causal probability modeling and quant analysis.

## 3. Gemini 3 Integration Strategy
Maximizing the Google AI Stack:
- **gemini-3-pro-preview**: Deployed for high-stakes reasoning.
- **Thinking Config**: "System 2 Thinking" with 16k-32k token budgets.
- **GATES Protocol**: Grounding, Analysis, Tracking, Evolution, Sovereign verification.

## 4. Governance & Ethical Safeguards
- **Bias Forensic Audit (RA-58)**: Real-time fairness monitoring.
- **Regulatory Sandbox (RA-29)**: Isolated ethical testing environments.
- **Sovereign Token Trace**: Radical transparency in decision-making paths.
